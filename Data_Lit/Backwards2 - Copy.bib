The application of AR-MBA is also increasingly widespread, starting from retail and hotels to hospitals. So, bibliometrics related to AR-MBA needs to be done to reveal what research opportunities can be later carried out by reviewing and analyzing publications about AR-MBA. 91 bibliographies in 1 decade from 2012-2022 were collected using Harzing's Publish or Perish (PoP).

This paper is innovative because it identifies trends and future research directions in data mining, specifically in association with AR-MBA. The findings show publication productivity, top authors, types of publications, annual topic trends within a decade, term distribution, most cited and most influential articles, and research gaps that can be opportunities for further research. © 2024, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.
