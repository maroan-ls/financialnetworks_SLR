Quantitative analysis of such a “network” structure had not been explored until recently, mainly due to limitations in the data available. This paper analyzes the “network” structure of financial transactions, using the logged data of financial transactions through the BOJ-Net (Current Account of the Bank of Japan), which became obtainable after the introduction of RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) in 2001.","2004-04","2023-07-22 18:35:26","2024-02-05 00:12:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\X84YG3FX\Inaoka et al. - Fractal Network derived from banking transaction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"STZUHAZL","journalArticle","1999","Borgatti, Stephen P; Everett, Martin G","Models of corerperiphery structures","Social Networks","","","","","A common but informal notion in social network analysis and other fields is the concept of a corerperiphery structure. The intuitive conception entails a dense, cohesive core and a sparse, unconnected periphery. This paper seeks to formalize the intuitive notion of a corerperiphery structure and suggests algorithms for detecting this structure, along with statistical tests for testing a priori hypotheses. Different models are presented for different kinds of graphs Ždirected and undirected, valued and nonvalued.. In addition, the close relation of the continuous models developed to certain centrality measures is discussed. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The system is composed by different banks exchanging on a daily basis loans and debts of liquidity. Through topological analysis and by means of a model of network growth we can determine the formation of different group of banks characterized by different business strategy. The model based on Pareto’s law makes no use of growth or preferential attachment and it reproduces correctly all the various statistical properties of the system. We believe that this network modeling of the market could be an efficient way to evaluate the impact of different policies in the market of liquidity.","2006-12-21","2024-02-04 21:00:22","2024-02-04 21:00:22","2024-02-04 21:00:22","066112","","6","74","","Phys.

In this context, we examine the ability of the overnight segment to guarantee the timely provision of unsecured funds to banks to smoothly absorb their liquidity shocks. This paper specifically focuses on the speed of reversion of transaction costs and available depth to their equilibrium levels in this market for overnight unsecured funds from 4 September 2000 to 31 December 2007. The reported evidence points to time-varying liquidity adjustments and identifies liquidity, market activity and the institutional setting of the ECB’s refinancing operations as significant determinants of the observed resiliency regimes. Our analysis also shows how the speed of mean reversion of market liquidity, by affecting the level and the volatility of the overnight market rate, also affects the anchoring of the yield curve in the euro area.","2012-11-27","2024-03-05 19:47:25","2024-03-05 19:47:25","2024-03-05 19:47:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\AMKINQHN\Beaupain and Durré - 2012 - Nonlinear Liquidity Adjustments in the Euro Area O.pdf","","","price impact; financial turmoil; market microstructure; mean reversion; overnight money market; transaction costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2181364","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
