The application of AR-MBA is also increasingly widespread, starting from retail and hotels to hospitals. So, bibliometrics related to AR-MBA needs to be done to reveal what research opportunities can be later carried out by reviewing and analyzing publications about AR-MBA. 91 bibliographies in 1 decade from 2012-2022 were collected using Harzing's Publish or Perish (PoP). VOSviewer is also employed to map authorship and publication topic trends. This paper is innovative because it identifies trends and future research directions in data mining, specifically in association with AR-MBA. The findings show publication productivity, top authors, types of publications, annual topic trends within a decade, term distribution, most cited and most influential articles, and research gaps that can be opportunities for further research. © 2024, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic and bibliometric methodology of assessing 369 peer-reviewed articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database was applied. The study also leverages key R-packages litsearchr and Bibliometrix software to enhance the descriptive and thematic literature analysis to identify gaps and opportunities for new research. Findings: This study confirms a rapid increase in articles on this thematic area, over the last decade, with increasing collaboration occurring among researchers in the United States, Europe, China, South Korea and India. Four core research clusters are identified. The first and largest cluster links interlocked directors to issues related to corporate governance and firm outcomes. The second cluster links social network theory, interlocking directorates and firm outcomes. Smaller emerging research clusters include topics related to ownership structure, board size, political connectedness and impacts on firm outcomes. The final cluster examines the influence of board interlocks on market value and firm innovation. Practical implications: Interlocked directors can have both positive and negative impacts on a wide variety of firm outcomes. This study places great interest in the selection of new directors, ensuring that the selection has aligned with the needs and interests of the company and disclosures of potential competing interests are declared and considered. Equally important are the governance practices used to monitor directors' behavior and to protect the interest of shareholders and the firm. This is particularly relevant in the internal appointment of interlocked directors to critical positions, such as audit committees or instances where interlocked directors may simultaneously hold CEO or executive leadership positions in other companies. Originality/value: This paper examines the board interlocks literature related to firm outcomes. Additionally, this review identifies several topics and disciplines which, if pursued, could enrich the literature and promise new avenues for future research. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Board of directors; Firm outcomes; Interlocked directors","","","","","","","","Abdelbadie R.A., Salama A., Corporate governance and financial stability in US banks: do indirect interlocks matter?, Journal of Business Research, 104, pp. 85-105, (2019); Al-Dah B., Director interlocks and the strategic pacing of CSR activities, Management Decision, 57, 10, pp. 2782-2798, (2019); Algthami N.M.J., Hussin N., Research on interlocking directorates in family business: evidence from Scopus bibliometric data, European Journal of Business and Management Research, 6, 4, pp. 332-343, (2021); Amendolagine V., Prota F., Bilateral investment treaties and backward linkages in Sub-Saharan Africa, International Economics, 165, pp. 172-185, (2021); Amendolagine V., Boly A., Coniglio N.D., Prota F., Seric A., FDI and local linkages in developing countries: evidence from sub-Saharan Africa, World Development, 50, pp. 41-56, (2013); Andres C., van den Bongard I., Lehmann M., Is busy really busy?

The analysis covers thirty-three commercial banks from seven CEE countries during 2006–2013. The results reveal that, on average, one-third of the graphs disclosed by a bank violate at least one graph-construction principle and there appears to be a favorable measurement-distortion bias. In line with expectations, there are signs that the impression motivation of managers increases during crisis periods—severe graph distortions are twice as frequent, and distortions of financial indicator graphs increase.

It has been shown how the network topology and the dynamics running on top of it can trigger the outbreak of large systemic crisis. Following this methodological perspective we introduce here the Accounting Network, i.e. the network we can extract through vector similarities techniques from companies' financial statements. We build the Accounting Network on a large database of worldwide banks in the period 2001-2013, covering the onset of the global financial crisis of mid-2007. After a careful data cleaning, we apply a quality check in the construction of the network, introducing a parameter (the Quality Ratio) capable of trading off the size of the sample (coverage) and the representativeness of the financial statements (accuracy). We compute several basic network statistics and check, with the Louvain community detection algorithm, for emerging communities of banks. Remarkably enough sensible regional aggregations show up with the Japanese and the US clusters dominating the community structure, although the presence of a geographically mixed community points to a gradual convergence of banks into similar supranational practices. Finally, a Principal Component Analysis procedure reveals the main economic components that influence communities' heterogeneity. Even using the most basic vector similarity hypotheses on the composition of the financial statements, the signature of the financial crisis clearly arises across the years around 2008. We finally discuss how the Accounting Networks can be improved to reflect the best practices in the financial statement analysis. © 2016 Puliga et al.
