In the case of economic and financial networks, privacy issues severely limit the information that can be accessed and, as a consequence, the possibility of correctly estimating the resilience of these systems to events such as financial shocks, crises and cascade failures. Here we present an innovative method to reconstruct the structure of such partially-accessible systems, based on the knowledge of intrinsic node-specific properties and of the number of connections of only a limited subset of nodes. This information is used to calibrate an inference procedure based on fundamental concepts derived from statistical physics, which allows to generate ensembles of directed weighted networks intended to represent the real system—so that the real network properties can be estimated as their average values within the ensemble. We test the method both on synthetic and empirical networks, focusing on the properties that are commonly used to measure systemic risk. Indeed, the method shows a remarkable robustness with respect to the limitedness of the information available, thus representing a valuable tool for gaining insights on privacy-protected economic and financial systems.","2015-10-28","2023-05-09 05:26:50","2023-05-09 05:26:50","2023-05-09 05:26:50","15758","","1","5","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2015 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\6SCRGABQ\Cimini et al. - 2015 - Systemic Risk Analysis on Reconstructed Economic a.pdf","","","Applied physics; Complex networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These datasets are often stored in silos within organisations for various reasons, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and business needs. As a result, data sharing within different lines of business as well as outside of the organisation (e.g. to the research community) is severely limited. It is therefore critical to investigate methods for synthesising financial datasets that follow the same properties of the real data while respecting the need for privacy of the parties involved. This introductory paper aims to highlight the growing need for effective synthetic data generation in the financial domain. We highlight three main areas of focus that are of particular importance while generating synthetic financial datasets: 1) Generating realistic synthetic datasets. 2) Measuring the similarities between real and generated datasets. 3) Ensuring the generative process satisfies any privacy constraints. Although these challenges are also present in other domains, the additional regulatory and privacy requirements within financial services present unique questions that are not asked elsewhere. Due to the size and influence of the financial services industry, answering these questions has the potential for a great and lasting impact. Finally, we aim to develop a shared vocabulary and context for generating synthetic financial data using two types of financial datasets as examples.","2021-10-07","2023-07-22 14:48:00","2024-01-21 21:25:38","2023-07-22","1–8","","","","","","Generating synthetic data in finance","ICAIF '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\UH4GNIID\Assefa et al. - 2021 - Generating synthetic data in finance opportunitie.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Assefa-et-al-2021-8293c5323aa24f6c968645bccd7e3826","vocuabulary; Scopus; notion; Overview","privacy preserving data generation; simulation; synthetic data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our data consists of quarterly networks constructed from the transactions on an electronic trading platform (e-MID) for interbank credit over the period from 2001 to 2010. The analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that the existence and extent of past credit relationships is a major determinant of credit provision (i.e., link formation) in subsequent periods. We also find explanatory power of size-related characteristics, but little influence of past interest rates. The actor-based analysis, thus, confirms the prevalent view that interbank credit is mainly determined by lasting business relationships and less so by competition for the best price (interest rate). Our findings also show that topological features exert a certain influence on the network formation process. The major changes found for the period after the onset of the financial crisis are that: (1) large banks and those identified as ‘core’ intermediaries became even more sought of as counterparties and (2) indirect counterparty risk appeared to be more of a concern as we find a higher tendency to avoid indirect exposure as indicated by clustering effects.","2017-01-01","2023-07-22 18:49:59","2023-07-22 18:49:59","2023-07-22 18:49:59","237-249","","","48","","Social Networks","Network formation in the interbank money market","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\VDTPQL34\Finger and Lux - 2017 - Network formation in the interbank money market A.pdf; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\KXJIAA7X\S0378873316303872.html","","","Financial crisis; Interbank market; Network formation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interbank market is interpreted as a network where banks are nodes and the claims and liabilities between banks define the links. This allows us to apply methods from general network theory. We find that the degree distributions of the interbank network follow power laws. Given this result we discuss how the network structure affects the stability of the banking system with respect to the elimination of a node in the network, i.e. the default of a single bank. Further, the interbank liability network shows a community structure that exactly mirrors the regional and sectoral organization of the current Austrian banking system. The banking network has the typical structural features found in numerous other complex real-world networks: a low clustering coefficient and a short average path length. These empirical findings are in marked contrast to the network structures that have been assumed thus far in the theoretical economic and econo-physics literature.","2004-12-01","2023-07-22 18:50:28","2023-12-20 16:51:56","2023-07-22 18:50:28","677-684","","6","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14697680400020325","","; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\7DV899R5\Boss et al. - 2004 - Network topology of the interbank market.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Boss-et-al-2004-6db5bfd6386c49e3af915ac723c1bf84","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Financial networks are constructed from dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) with graph filtering method of minimum spanning trees (MSTs). Then we investigate dynamics of systemic risk contributions of financial institution. Also we study dynamics of financial institution’s local topology structure in the financial network.

However, in financial network models, the details of how financial institutions interact typically play a decisive role, and a general understanding of precisely how network topology creates instability remains lacking. Here we show how processes that are widely believed to stabilize the financial system, that is, market integration and diversification, can actually drive it towards instability, as they contribute to create cyclical structures which tend to amplify financial distress, thereby undermining systemic stability and making large crises more likely. This result holds irrespective of the details of how institutions interact, showing that policy-relevant analysis of the factors affecting financial stability can be carried out while abstracting away from such details.","2017-02-21","2023-07-22 19:17:19","2024-01-10 20:34:26","2023-07-22 19:17:19","14416","","1","8","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\YH7MBARF\Bardoscia et al. - 2017 - Pathways towards instability in financial networks.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Bardoscia-et-al-2017-0c7499bd485e45a48ad7846a66fafd1c","notion","Complex networks; Applied mathematics; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method loads the most probable links with the largest exposures consistent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank, yielding networks with minimum density. When used in a stress-testing context, the minimum-density solution overestimates contagion, whereas maximum entropy underestimates it.

Based on the analysis of nonlinear relationships among sectors, this paper realizes the accurate construction of “time-varying” financial network from the perspective of risk spillover. The results are presented as follow: (1) interactions can be better understood through the nonlinear networks among distinct sectors, and sectors in the networks could be classified into different types according to their topological properties connected to risk spillover; (2) in the rising stage, information is transmitted rapidly in the network, so the risk is fast diffused and absorbed; (3) in the declining stage, the network topology is more complex and panic sentiments have long term impact leading to more connections; (4) The US market, Japan market and Hongkong market have significant affect on China’s market. The results suggest that this nonlinear measure is an effective approach to develop financial networks and explore the mechanism of risk spillover. Copyright: © 2021 Li et al.

This paper introduces a financial network model that combines the default and liquidity stress mechanisms into a “double cascade mapping”. The progress and eventual result of the crisis is obtained by iterating this mapping to its fixed point. Unlike simpler models, this model can therefore quantify how illiquidity or default of one bank influences the overall level of liquidity stress and default in the system. Large-network asymptotic cascade mapping formulas are derived that can be used for efficient network computations of the double cascade. Numerical experiments then demonstrate that these asymptotic formulas agree qualitatively with Monte Carlo results for large finite networks, and quantitatively except when the initial system is placed in an exceptional “knife-edge” configuration. The experiments clearly support the main conclusion that when banks respond to liquidity stress by hoarding liquidity, then in the absence of asset fire sales, the level of defaults in a financial network is negatively related to the strength of bank liquidity hoarding and the eventual level of stress in the network.","2016-08","2023-09-19 18:13:09","2024-01-06 17:04:19","2023-09-19 18:13:09","1650041","","05","19","","Int.

Using two different hyperbolic embedding methods, hydra+ and Mercator, this allows us to connect the network structure to the popularity-vs-similarity model of Papdopoulos et al., which is based on the Poincaré disc model of hyperbolic geometry. We show that the latent dimensions of ‘popularity’ and ‘similarity’ in this model are strongly associated to systemic importance and to geographic subdivisions of the banking system, independent of the embedding method that is used. In a longitudinal analysis over the time span from 2014 to 2018 we find that the systemic importance of individual banks has remained rather stable, while the peripheral community structure exhibits more (but still moderate) variability. Based on our analysis we argue that embeddings into hyperbolic geometry can be used to monitor structural change in financial networks and are able to distinguish between changes in systemic relevance and other (peripheral) structural changes.","2021-02-26","2023-09-19 18:23:05","2024-01-06 17:40:00","2023-09-19 18:23:05","4732","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\QFTMU7Q5\Keller-Ressel and Nargang - 2021 - The hyperbolic geometry of financial networks.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Keller-Ressel-Nargang-2021-7feb0324b90445ec8f912f0f31f9f38e","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we analyze the community structure of each bank’s correlation network and verify the effectiveness of the community division from the point of view of the importance of nodes. Then, combining the data of failed banks after the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, we ﬁnd that for small communities, the ﬁnancial systemic risk will appear to have obvious volatility, and it is quite likely to reach an extremely high level. With the increase in the number of nodes in the community, systemic risk will tend towards a stable and low level. Furthermore, if only communities with failed banks are considered, the regression analysis shows that systemic risk and the size of the community almost follow a power law distribution trend.

In this work, we propose a two-stage approach for directed acyclic graph skeleton estimation for highly correlated variables. In the ﬁrst stage, a variable screening ensemble is incorporated into the sparse partial least squares regression method to both reduce the size of the active variables set and impose an adaptive penalization on the weight vectors. In the second stage, a modiﬁed PC algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is applied to remove the false positive edges.

In our model, credit linkages evolve endogenously via a ﬁtness measure based on diﬀerent banks' strategies. Each ﬁnancial institution, in fact, applies a strategy based on a low interest rate, a high supply of liquidity or a combination of them. Interestingly, the choice of the strategy inﬂuences both the banks' performance and the network topology. In this way, we are able to identify the most eﬀective tactics adapt to contain contagion and the corresponding network topology. Our analysis shows that, when ﬁnancial institutions combine the two strategies, the interbank network does not condense and this generates the most eﬃcient scenario in case of shocks.","2017-01","2023-09-19 22:26:14","2024-01-07 14:48:35","2023-09-19 22:26:14","255-272","","","47","","International Review of Economics & Finance","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\VX9LBDW8\Berardi and Tedeschi - 2017 - From banks' strategies to financial (in)stability.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Berardi-Tedeschi-2017-e44f619657d84c58a73417771667ad7c","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We capture seniority of debt in a multiplex network, a graph of nodes connected by multiple types of edges. Here an edge between banks denotes a debt contract of a certain level of seniority. Next we study cascading default. There exist multiple kinds of bankruptcy, indexed by the highest level of seniority at which a bank cannot repay all its debts. Self-interested banks would prefer that all their loans be made at the most senior level. However, mixing debts of different seniority levels makes the system more stable in that it shrinks the set of network densities for which bankruptcies spread widely. We compute the optimal ratio of senior to junior debts, which we call the optimal seniority ratio, for two uncorrelated Erdős-Rényi networks. If institutions erode their buffer against insolvency, then this optimal seniority ratio rises; in other words, if default thresholds fall, then more loans should be senior. We generalize the analytical results to arbitrarily many levels of seniority and to heavy-tailed degree distributions.","2015-06-24","2023-10-19 19:28:13","2024-01-07 19:47:15","2023-10-19 19:28:13","062813","","6","91","","Phys.

We find that greater heterogeneity has a stabilizing effect for networks that are sparsely connected and a destabilizing effect for networks that are highly interconnected.

We analytically characterise the influence of network structure on the propagation of monetary shocks.

In the short run, monetary shocks propagate upstream via nominal changes in demand and downstream via real changes in supply. Lags in the evolution of supply and demand at the micro level can give rise to arbitrary dynamics of the distribution of prices. Our model provides an explanation of the price puzzle: a temporary rise in the price level in response to monetary contractions. In our setting, the puzzle emerges under two assumptions about downstream firms: they are disproportionally affected by monetary contractions and they account for a sufficiently small share of the wage bill. Empirical evidence supports the two assumptions for the US economy. Our model calibrated to the US economy using a data set of more than fifty thousand firms generates the empirically observed magnitude of the price level rise after monetary contractions.","2021-04-01","2023-10-19 20:19:25","2024-01-07 20:05:09","2023-10-19 20:19:25","104084","","","125","","Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\FNN6EXGV\Mandel and Veetil - 2021 - Monetary dynamics in a network economy.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Mandel-Veetil-2021-7dd757018a374a968ce888c89a2ad007","notion","Monetary non-Neutrality; Money; Out-of-Equilibrium dynamics; Price puzzle; Production network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The modular structure of the framework allows to accommodate for a variety of shock scenarios, methods to estimate interbank exposures and mechanisms of distress propagation. The main features are as follows. First, the framework allows to estimate and disentangle not only first-round effects (i.e. shock on external assets) and second-round effects (i.e. distress induced in the interbank network), but also third-round effects induced by possible fire sales. Second, it allows to monitor at the same time the impact of shocks on individual or groups of financial institutions as well as their vulnerability to shocks on counterparties or certain asset classes. Third, it includes estimates for loss distributions, thus combining network effects with familiar risk measures such as VaR and CVaR. Fourth, in order to perform robustness analyses and cope with incomplete data, the framework features a module for the generation of sets of networks of interbank exposures that are coherent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank. As an illustration, we carry out a stress-test exercise on a dataset of listed European banks over the years 2008–2013.

The key element in the model is the introduction of a Fermi–Dirac $$\kappa $$ as a proxy of banks’ consistency in their behavior in the interbank market. For different growth–volatility scenarios we analyze, how the consistency interplays with the value of capital-base in the banking system.

Scale-free networks are commonly observed in a wide array of different contexts such as nature and society. In this paper, the nodes are comprised by customers of the bank (legal entities) and the links are established by payments between these nodes. We study the scaling-free and structural properties of this network. We also describe its topology, components and behaviors. We show that this network shares typical structural characteristics known in other complex networks: degree distributions follow a power law, low clustering coefficient and low average shortest path length. We identify the key nodes of the network and perform simulations of resiliency against random and targeted attacks of the nodes with two different approaches. With this, we find that by identifying and studying the links between the nodes is possible to perform vulnerability analysis of the Estonian economy with respect to economic shocks.","2016-09-01","2023-10-19 20:39:03","2024-01-07 20:39:01","2023-10-19 20:39:03","18-27","","","90","","Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","On the topologic structure of economic complex networks","Challenges in Data Science","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\XW3262LZ\Rendón de la Torre et al. - 2016 - On the topologic structure of economic complex net.pdf; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\M3PNS7S2\S0960077916300091.html","notion://www.notion.so/Rend-n-de-la-Torre-et-al-2016-cc59329b7c4e4e63b409ce1dbcb6ed1d","notion","Economic networks; Network topology; Complex systems; Scale-free networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that techniques such as maximum entropy currently used to reconstruct credit networks severely underestimate the risk of contagion by assuming a trivial (fully connected) topology, a type of network structure which can be very different from the one empirically observed. We propose an efficient message-passing algorithm to explore the space of possible network structures and show that a correct estimation of the network degree of connectedness leads to more reliable estimations for systemic risk. Such an algorithm is also able to produce maximally fragile structures, providing a practical upper bound for the risk of contagion when the actual network structure is unknown. We test our algorithm on ensembles of synthetic data encoding some features of real financial networks (sparsity and heterogeneity), finding that more accurate estimations of risk can be achieved.

This method uses the knowledge of an intrinsic property of the nodes (indicated as fitness), and the number of connections of only a limited subset of nodes, in order to generate an ensemble of exponential random graphs that are representative of the real systems and that can be used to estimate its topological properties. Here we focus in particular on reconstructing the most basic properties that are commonly used to describe a network: density of links, assortativity, clustering.

From the conditional tail risk networks we can then compute synthetic indices of systemic risk for each bank. An additional set of systemic risk indicators is computed by considering together the network of conditional tail risk and bank-specific indicators of credit risk (as an example we use the ratio of non-performing loans, NPL). The empirical analysis focuses on the European banking system and considers a panel of 36 representative banks. Among the main findings, we found evidence of regional clusters of interconnected banks, especially in crisis period.

Defaults tend to cluster around times of economic stress due to poor macro-economic conditions, but also by directly triggering each other through contagion. Although credit default swaps have radically altered the dynamics of contagion for more than a decade, models quantifying their impact on systemic risk are still missing. Here, we examine contagion through credit default swaps in a stylized economic network of corporates and ﬁnancial institutions. We analyse such a system using a stochastic setting, which allows us to exploit limit theorems to exactly solve the contagion dynamics for the entire system. Our analysis shows that, by creating additional contagion channels, CDS can actually lead to greater instability of the entire network in times of economic stress. This is particularly pronounced when CDS are used by banks to expand their loan books (arguing that CDS would oﬄoad the additional risks from their balance sheets). Thus, even with complete hedging through CDS, a signiﬁcant loan book expansion can lead to considerably enhanced probabilities for the occurrence of very large losses and very high default rates in the system. Our approach adds a new dimension to research on credit contagion, and could feed into a rational underpinning of an improved regulatory framework for credit derivatives.","2012-04","2023-10-19 22:42:31","2024-01-07 21:23:51","2023-10-19 22:42:31","115","","4","85","","Eur.

So far, much attention has been devoted to detect modular and bimodular structures on binary networks. This effort has led to the definition of a framework based upon the score function called ‘surprise’, i.e. a p-value that can be assigned to any given partition of nodes. Hereby, we make a step further and extend the entire framework to the weighted case: six variants of surprise, induced by just as many variants of the hypergeometric distribution, are, thus, considered. As a result, a general, statistically grounded approach for detecting mesoscale network structures via a unified, suprise-based framework is presented. To illustrate its performances, both synthetic benchmarks and real-world configurations are considered. Moreover, we attach to the paper a Python code implementing all variants of surprise discussed in the present manuscript.","2022-05-30","2023-10-19 22:56:41","2024-01-07 22:03:26","2023-10-19 22:56:41","132","","1","5","","Commun Phys","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\CF88853H\Marchese et al. - 2022 - Detecting mesoscale structures by surprise.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Marchese-et-al-2022-c17ffa18a3864a95b46423f3e8455e36","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One important part of the financial system is the interbank payment system. This paper develops a robust measure, SinkRank, that accurately predicts the magnitude of disruption caused by the failure of a bank in a payment system and identifies banks most affected by the failure. SinkRank is based on absorbing Markov chains, which are well-suited to model liquidity dynamics in payment systems. Because actual bank failures are rare and the data is not generally publicly available, the authors test the metric by simulating payment networks and inducing failures in them. They test SinkRank on several types of payment networks, including Barabási-Albert types of scale-free networks modeled on the Fedwire system, and find that the failing bank’s SinkRank is highly correlated with the resulting disruption in the system overall; moreover, the SinkRank algorithm can identify which individual banks would be most disrupted by a given failure.","2013-12-01","2023-10-21 12:15:34","2024-01-07 22:19:12","2023-10-21 12:15:34","","","1","7","","","SinkRank","","","","","","","en","De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","","","","www.degruyter.com","","Publisher: De Gruyter Open Access","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\M8NU4QEJ\Soramäki and Cook - 2013 - SinkRank An Algorithm for Identifying Systemicall.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Soram-ki-Cook-2013-76d2b8aec6d847359ef36357c014321c","notion","absorbing system; graph theory; Markov distance; Payment systems; systemic importance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The metric is based on perturbing the adjacency matrix and observing the resultant change in its largest eigenvalues. We then propose a model of network evolution where this metric controls the probabilities of subsequent edge changes. We show using synthetic data how the parameters of the model are related to the capability of predicting whether an edge will change from its value of $l_{e}$ . We then estimate the model parameters associated with five real financial and social networks, and we study their predictability. These methods have applications in financial regulation whereby it is important to understand how individual changes to financial networks will impact their global behaviour. It also provides fundamental insights into spectral predictability in networks, and it demonstrates how spectral perturbations can be a useful tool in understanding the interplay between micro and macro features of networks.","2021-12","2023-10-21 12:38:59","2024-01-07 22:42:39","2023-10-21 12:38:59","1-23","","1","10","","EPJ Data Sci.","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","epjdatascience.springeropen.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: SpringerOpen","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\B6CILB5P\Seabrook et al. - 2021 - Evaluating structural edge importance in temporal .pdf; ; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\CHNKX9Z8\supplement_13688_2021_279_MOESM1_ESM.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Seabrook-et-al-2021-d1250f66d33e4cbe81a0c20a22c12bb4","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The core of the methodology is a non-negative matrix factorization that maximizes a Poisson likelihood subject to a penalty that accounts for sparsity in the network. By fitting the factorization model over a rolling window with a fast numerical optimization algorithm, change detection is accomplished by statistical monitoring of the matrix factors’ evolution. A novel statistic is used to characterize the overall network evolution as well as the contribution of each node to the change. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology compares favorably with alternative techniques for on-the-go network change detection using synthetic and real data.

The high dimensional embeddings learn complex associations that transcend the human cognitive understanding and have achieved great success in different business applications that encounter the curse of dimensionality, including fin-tech. Different algorithms learn embeddings that capture different types of associations, and it would be useful to learn embeddings that holistically learn multi-dimensional associations. In this paper, we propose DeepGRASS – an algorithm that embeds financial transactions using graph and sequence-based topologies. Our results show that these embeddings learn associations that are very comprehensive, holistic, and multi-dimensional.We deploy DeepGRASS in PayPal, and train it on multitude of transaction data with multi-dimensional features. The algorithm is two-fold: it embeds a bipartite graph with customer and merchant nodes and parallelly learns sequential associations using historical transactions along with other transactional features. These embeddings are then scaled and combined to learn multidimensional associations. We tested this on different predictive applications and find that the learning is generic and shows benchmarking performance in different predictive contexts. Based on offline metrics, back-tests, and sensitivity analysis on offline transaction data, we find very strong evidence to suggest that these embeddings provide the highest AUC score in predictive applications, highest co-efficient of determination in explaining variance and the features explain different types of associations. To our knowledge, this is the first application of embeddings that learn both graph and sequence-based associations on large scale financial transaction data and paves the way for a new generation of feature engineering in fin-tech.","2021-12","2023-10-21 19:07:25","2024-01-08 22:54:57","2023-10-21 19:07:25","1-6","","","","","","DeepGRASS","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\Q77H5R7Y\Balan Umaithanu et al. - 2021 - DeepGRASS Graph, Sequence and Scaled Embeddings o.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Balan-Umaithanu-et-al-2021-4e9f6894fa5545e691bb87549a92ff31","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 Swedish Workshop on Data Science (SweDS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This kind of illegal activities involve complex networks of trade and financial transactions, which makes it difficult to detect the fraud entities and discover the features of fraud. Fortunately, trading/transaction network and features of entities in the network can be constructed from the complex networks of the trade and financial transactions. The trading/transaction network reveals the interaction between entities, and thus anomaly detection on trading networks can reveal the entities involved in the fraud activity; while features of entities are the description of entities, and anomaly detection on features can reflect details of the fraud activities. Thus, network and features provide complementary information for fraud detection, which has potential to improve fraud detection performance. However, the majority of existing methods focus on networks or features information separately, which does not utilize both information. In this paper, we propose a novel fraud detection framework, CoDetect, which can leverage both network information and feature information for financial fraud detection. In addition, the CoDetect can simultaneously detecting financial fraud activities and the feature patterns associated with the fraud activities. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed framework in combating financial fraud, especially for money laundering.","2018","2023-10-21 21:49:55","2024-01-10 23:37:21","2023-10-21 21:49:55","19161-19174","","","6","","","CoDetect","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\8MVJR6SK\Huang et al. - 2018 - CoDetect Financial Fraud Detection With Anomaly F.pdf; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\IDFYWHWG\8325544.html; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\NVF28CSG\Huang et al. - 2018 - CoDetect Financial Fraud Detection With Anomaly F.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Huang-et-al-2018-3b21b08b392e4b318f6e36904bc72b1d","Scopus; notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flow-based clustering in networks requires a set of closely related vertices where the ﬂow amount getting into it is larger than that going out of it. It is able to formulate a variety of practical problems, such as fund-raising set detection in ﬁnancial networks and inﬂuential document clustering in citation networks, etc. Methodologically, we propose the new concept of two-dimensional structural entropy on directed graphs, and based on this, a local structural entropy minimization algorithm for detecting the ﬂow-based community structure of networks is designed. We adopt our algorithm for the problem of fundraising set detection in ﬁnancial networks, in which vertices represent accounts, edges represent transactions between two accounts, and weights represent money amounts of transactions. In our experiments, the local two-dimensional structure entropy minimization algorithm is devoted to ﬁnd a fund-raising community which involves a given input account. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real fund-raising datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, given a ﬁxed account, our algorithm is able to efﬁciently locate a fund-raising community (if any) for which the fund ﬂowing into the community is much higher than that ﬂowing out, and the transactions within the community are relatively denser (fund amount based) than that of inter-community. For a synthetic ground-truth fund-raising community, we adjust the parameters to change its fund-raising tendency. The results for the synthetic datasets show that our algorithm obtains higher precision and recall rates as this tendency gets stronger with each single factor varing. For a real fund-raising community embedded in a simulated capital ﬂow network, our algorithm also ﬁnd it with high precision and recall rates. The experiments for both scenarios verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.","2020","2023-10-21 23:17:51","2024-01-08 23:43:57","2023-10-21 23:17:51","152579-152591","","","8","","IEEE Access","Flow-Based Clustering on Directed Graphs","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\PM3TYHID\Yao et al. - 2020 - Flow-Based Clustering on Directed Graphs A Struct.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Yao-et-al-2020-6f3cdfeaadf744168a26a207cd8b866b","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we address the use of motifs as network primitives using the cluster expansion from statistical physics. By mapping the network motifs to clusters in the gas model, we derive the partition function for a network, and this allows us to calculate global thermodynamic quantities, such as energy and entropy. We present analytical expressions for the number of certain types of motifs, and compute their associated entropy. We conduct numerical experiments for synthetic and real-world data sets and evaluate the qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the motif entropy derived from the partition function. We find that the motif entropy for real-world networks, such as financial stock market networks, is sensitive to the variance in network structure.

Thus the classifier built on such skewed data streams tends to misclassify the minority class examples. In case of some applications like financial fraud detection the identification of fraudulent transaction is the main focus because here misclassification of such minority class instances will result in financial loss. Similarly in case of many other real life data stream applications the misclassification costs associated with minority class instances are higher and they need proactive treatment.

Using the so-called graph-shift operator (GSO), which is a matrix representation of the graph, we ﬁrst identify the eigenvectors of the shift matrix from observations of the diffused signals, and then estimate the eigenvalues by imposing desirable properties on the graph to be recovered. Different from the stationary setting where the eigenvectors can be obtained directly from the covariance matrix of the measurements, here we need to estimate ﬁrst the unknown diffusion (graph) ﬁlter – a polynomial in the GSO that preserves the sought eigenbasis. To carry out this initial system identiﬁcation step, we exploit different sources of information on the arbitrarily-correlated input signal driving the diffusion on the graph. We ﬁrst explore the setting where the observations, the input information, and the unknown graph ﬁlter are linearly related. We then address the case where the relation is given by a system of matrix quadratic equations, which arises in pragmatic scenarios where only the second-order statistics of the inputs are available. While such a quadratic ﬁlter identiﬁcation problem boils down to a non-convex fourth-order polynomial minimization, we discuss identiﬁability conditions, propose algorithms to approximate the solution, and analyze their performance.

It has been studied under the contexts of dynamic graphs and attributed graphs separately. In many practical applications, graphs with dynamic attributes provide crucial information for such detections, yet there exist few studies on discovering anomalies in dynamic attributed graphs. Therein, we present a novel framework for deﬁning and detecting anomalies in dynamic attributed graphs, where communities and outliers are mined in succession. Speciﬁcally, we propose a community detection model that combines dynamic graph clustering with learning of latent network structures into a uniﬁed optimization problem.

Discovery of the underlying influence network among the dimensions of multi-dimensional temporal processes is of high importance in disciplines where a high-frequency data is to model, e.g. in financial data or in seismological data. This paper approaches the problem of learning Granger-causal network in multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. We formulate this problem as a model selection task in which we follow the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Moreover, we propose a general algorithm for MDL-based inference using a Monte-Carlo method and we use it for our causal discovery problem. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on synthetic and real-world financial data. The synthetic experiments demonstrate superiority of our method in causal graph discovery compared to the baseline methods with respect to the size of the data.

In this context, we develop novel algorithms for online network topology inference given streaming observations assumed to be smooth on the sought graph. Unlike existing batch algorithms, our goal is to track the (possibly) time-varying network topology while maintaining the memory and computational costs in check by processing graph signals sequentially-in-time. To recover the graph in an online fashion, we leverage proximal gradient (PG) methods to solve a judicious smoothness-regularized, time-varying optimization problem. Under mild technical conditions, we establish that the online graph learning algorithm converges to within a neighborhood of (i.e., it tracks) the optimal time-varying batch solution.

One of the important problems connected with the market graph is its identiﬁcation from observations. The standard way of identifying the market graph is to use a simple procedure based on statistical estimations of Pearson correlations between pairs of stocks. Recently a new class of statistical procedures for market graph identiﬁcation was introduced and the optimality of these procedures in the Pearson correlation Gaussian network was proved. However, the procedures obtained have a high reliability only for Gaussian multivariate distributions of stock attributes. One of the ways to correct this problem is to consider different networks generated by different measures of pairwise similarity of stocks. A new and promising model in this context is the sign similarity network. In this paper the market graph identiﬁcation problem in the sign similarity network is reviewed. A new class of statistical procedures for the market graph identiﬁcation is introduced and the optimality of these procedures is proved. Numerical experiments reveal an essential difference in the quality between optimal procedures in sign similarity and Pearson correlation networks.

We investigate modifications to widely used penalized log-likelihood approaches to enforce total positivity but not the Laplacian structure. The graph Laplacian can then be extracted from the off-diagonal precision matrix. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented and analyzed for constrained optimization under Laplacian-related constraints and lasso as well as adaptive lasso penalties.

Our results emphasize the role played by “contagious links” and show that institutions which contribute most to network instability have both large connectivity and a large fraction of contagious links. The asymptotic results show good agreement with simulations for networks with realistic sizes.","2016","2023-11-02 20:29:04","2024-01-10 21:25:21","2023-11-02 20:29:04","329-365","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2016 The Authors.

In this paper we investigate how systemic risk is affected by the structure of the financial system. We construct banking systems that are composed of a number of banks that are connected by interbank linkages. We then vary the key parameters that define the structure of the financial system - including its level of capitalisation, the degree to which banks are connected, the size of interbank exposures and the degree of concentration of the system - and analyse the influence of these parameters on the likelihood of contagious (knock-on) defaults. First, we find that the better capitalised banks are, the more resilient is the banking system against contagious defaults and this effect is non-linear. Second, the effect of the degree of connectivity is non-monotonic, that is, initially a small increase in connectivity increases the contagion effect; but after a certain threshold value, connectivity improves the ability of a banking system to absorb shocks. Third, the size of interbank liabilities tends to increase the risk of knock-on default, even if banks hold capital against such exposures. Fourth, more concentrated banking systems are shown to be prone to larger systemic risk, all else equal. In an extension to the main analysis we study how liquidity effects interact with banking structure to produce a greater chance of systemic breakdown. We finally consider how the risk of contagion might depend on the degree of asymmetry (tiering) inherent in the structure of the banking system. A number of our results have important implications for public policy, which this paper also draws out.","2008-04-01","2023-11-02 21:02:52","2024-01-10 21:32:53","2023-11-02 21:02:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\C3JLIIFS\Nier et al. - 2008 - Network Models and Financial Stability.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Nier-et-al-2008-c3be98518acd4b9d8002972c2f53d886","notion","contagion; financial stability; Networks; liquidity risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1280788","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, network-based methods have been widely used to identify SIFIs by considering the complex relationship of financial institutions. However, most existing network-based methodologies typically use a single measure. In this study, we first identify SIFIs from three different perspectives, including the market value of financial institutions, the correlation between financial institutions, and the risk spillover between financial institutions. Then, we first employ the stock price volatility and investor sentiment data to form a multiplex financial network with four layers based on variance decompositions and correlation-based methods. Moreover, by incorporating features of the multiplex financial network and institutions’ market value, we identify SIFIs with technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). Furthermore, we conduct an empirical analysis of the Chinese financial market from 2016 to 2020. The results indicate that national commercial banks and Internet financial securities play an essential role in the Chinese financial system during the period, while insurances are not sensitive to price volatility and investors’ sentiment. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach is valid to identify SIFIs from multiple perspectives, which can be generalized to other regional financial markets for identifying SIFIs.","2023-02-01","2023-11-13 00:11:03","2024-01-10 22:13:02","2023-11-13 00:11:03","128446","","","611","","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","Identification of systemically important financial institutions in a multiplex financial network","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\94WGHWE4\Jiang et al. - 2023 - Identification of systemically important financial.pdf; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\IEUWU46X\S0378437123000018.html","notion://www.notion.so/Jiang-et-al-2023-5b10aa98205744b198131bb6f833c601","notion","Financial networks; Multiplex networks; Systemically important financial institutions; Financial markets; Multi-attribute decision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Having powerful tools to analyze and predict systemic risk in large financial networks is essential to ensure the stability of the financial system, avoiding the negative externalities derived from the failure of a systemically important financial institution. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) has proved to be a useful tool thanks to its ability to deal with complex relations. However, traditional techniques are limited in their use of the interactions between entities and the network structure, which has been shown to be of great importance for systemic risk. Thus, this work proposes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for systemic risk analysis. GNNs use the network structure and feature information to deal with large-scale financial networks, providing the benefits of ML while using all the available information (node inter-relations and node, edge, and graph features). We also present C2R, an approach to reduce the pre-labeling effort for costly systemic risk metrics by pre-labeling into a small number of classes while predicting continuous risk scores. We have tested GNNs against traditional ML in classifying entities by systemic risk importance in two different networks, comparing their generalization capabilities with different amounts of available data. GNNs achieve a 94% and 15% Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) average percentage increase compared to ML, achieving statistically significant MCC improvements in most scenarios. When combining C2R with GNNs to predict the systemic risk quantile from the class labels, the models achieve statistically significant improvements in the quantile RMSE. From our experiments, we can confirm that GNN models are better suited for systemic risk prediction on financial networks and should be preferred over traditional Machine Learning. The results obtained also confirm the fact that the network structure and the features of the relations (edge features) hold useful information for our task.","2023-09-01","2023-12-12 20:55:26","2024-01-11 00:02:27","2023-12-12 20:55:26","200240","","","19","","Intelligent Systems with Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\6PFXTQY5\Balmaseda et al. - 2023 - Predicting systemic risk in financial systems usin.pdf; ; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\NAZCYFQS\S2667305323000650.html","notion://www.notion.so/Balmaseda-et-al-2023-9ef73dea13fb4619abb11e29c7d58026","notion","Financial networks modeling; Graph neural networks (GNN); Label regression; Model selection; Network simulation; Neural networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, developing a fraud detection system to identify the fraudulent activities is an important area of research to improve the credibility of credit card-based digital transactions. In this study, a fraud detection system has been proposed based on application of graph database model. The graph features being extracted using Neo4j tool are incorporated with several other features of transaction database. Subsequently, five supervised and two unsupervised machine learning algorithms are applied to them in order to detect fraudulent transactions explicitly. The features directly obtained from the transactional data are also tested with the classification models for detecting the fraudulent transactions. Critical assessment for performance of the machine learning algorithms has been carried out based on the features extracted from graph database and features extracted directly from the transaction database.","2021-09-01","2023-12-12 21:08:24","2024-01-09 23:48:09","2023-12-12 21:08:24","1-20","","9","46","","Arab J Sci Eng","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\SC8E892P\Prusti et al. - 2021 - Credit Card Fraud Detection Technique by Applying .pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Prusti-et-al-2021-a2fd51b551cd4f2d8758ee47e806a9d7","notion","Credit card fraud detection; Graph database model; Graph feature; Neo4j tool","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting money laundering transactions among large volumes of financial data in an efficient and accurate manner. We propose a framework that applies case reduction methods to progressively reduce the input data set to a significantly smaller size. The framework then scans the reduced data to find pairs of transactions with common attributes and behaviours that are potentially involved in ML activities. It then applies a clustering method to detect potential ML groups. We present preliminary experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","2016-10","2023-12-12 21:13:32","2024-01-09 23:52:21","2023-12-12 21:13:32","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\HLFRKKZP\7777919.html; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\DQ6MACKB\Soltani et al. - 2016 - A new algorithm for money laundering detection bas.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Soltani-et-al-2016-c7e314509681467db9c817c222f17286","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So-called firm-to-firm transaction networks are valuable in analyzing a market or an economy. However, such detailed and complete data is seldom available. In this work, we aim at supporting economists by reusing available financial information from different sources at different levels of detail and completeness. With our technique, experts' domain knowledge can be fused together with publicly available information to extract a representative, coherent instance of the transaction network. Supporting underspecification is important, as experts may develop partial econometric models. Our technique fills such blanks by systematically guesstimating missing information. Our approach builds upon formal foundations of satisfiability modulo theories and thus obtained transaction networks respect constraints imposed by domain knowledge and input data sources. We outline a taxonomy of general data types in the domain, and we programmatically construct formal predicates describing them. We demonstrate both guestimation of missing information of a transaction network and validation of external, expert-provided models. Finally, we investigate feasibility and performance of the advocated technique over a fragment of the Austrian economy.","2019-07","2023-12-12 21:52:00","2024-01-11 00:13:51","2023-12-12 21:52:00","15-22","","","","","","How Do Firms Transact?","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\SZX3R4PI\8843449.html; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\A2MZ3PWQ\Tsigkanos et al. - 2019 - How Do Firms Transact Guesstimation and Validatio.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Tsigkanos-et-al-2019-491a16cb1a6b477fb4a19649a4d4a5b2","notion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE 20th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important area of research is to study how well real networks can be described with a small selection of metrics, furthermore how well network models can capture the relations between graph metrics observed in real networks. In this paper, we apply machine-learning techniques to investigate the aforementioned problems. We study 500 real-world networks along with 2000 synthetic networks generated by four frequently used network models with previously calibrated parameters to make the generated graphs as similar to the real networks as possible. This paper unifies several branches of data-driven complex network analysis, such as the study of graph metrics and their pair-wise relationships, network similarity estimation, model calibration, and graph classification. We find that the correlation profiles of the structural measures significantly differ across network domains and the domain can be efficiently determined using a small selection of graph metrics. The structural properties of the network models with fixed parameters are robust enough to perform parameter calibration. The goodness-of-fit of the network models highly depends on the network domain. By solving classification problems, we find that the models lack the capability of generating a graph with a high clustering coefficient and relatively large diameter simultaneously. On the other hand, models are able to capture exactly the degree-distribution-related metrics.","2022-06","2024-01-23 01:21:42","2024-01-23 01:21:42","2024-01-23 01:21:42","146-169","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\PDGHKVWR\Nagy and Molontay - 2022 - Network classification-based structural analysis o.pdf","","","complex networks; network models; domain prediction; model calibration; model stability; network characteristics; network classification; network similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We confirm the presence of significant temporal proximity effects between markets and somewhat weaker temporal effects with regard to the US equity market - volatility spillovers decrease when markets are characterized by greater temporal proximity. Volatility spillovers also present a high degree of interconnectedness, which is measured by high spatial autocorrelation. This finding is confirmed by spatial regression models showing that indirect effects are much stronger than direct effects, i.e., market-related changes in ""neighboring"" markets (within a network) affect volatility spillovers more than changes in the given market alone.

However, little is known about how interbank networks are formed and about their sensitivity to changes in key bank parameters (for example, induced by common exogenous shocks or by regulatory initiatives). This paper aims to shed light on these issues by modelling endogenously the formation of interbank networks, which in turn allows for checking the sensitivity of interbank network structures and hence, their underlying contagion risk to changes in market-driven parameters as well as to changes in regulatory measures such as large exposures limits. The sequential network formation mechanism presented in the paper is based on a portfolio optimization model, whereby banks allocate their interbank exposures while balancing the return and risk of counterparty default risk and the placements are accepted taking into account funding diversification benefits. The model offers some interesting insights into how key parameters may affect interbank network structures and can be a valuable tool for analysing the impact of various regulatory policy measures relating to banks' incentives to operate in the interbank market.","2015","2024-02-04 22:56:43","2024-02-05 00:01:27","2024-02-04 22:56:43","653-671","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis Journals","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\XQ7G562V\v15y2015i4p653-671.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How important this effect of “too-big-too-fail” and “too-interconnected-too-fail” is, depends on the exact topology of the network on which the supervisory authorities have typically very incomplete knowledge. We propose a probabilistic model to combine some important known quantities (like the size of the banks) with a realistic stochastic representation of the remaining structural elements.

We assume to know for all the nodes a non-topological quantity that we interpret as fitness. In contrast, we assume to know the degree, i.e. the number of connections, only for a subset of the nodes in the network. We then use a fitness model, calibrated on the subset of nodes for which degrees are known, in order to generate ensembles of networks. Here, we focus on topological properties that are relevant for processes of contagion and distress propagation in networks, i.e. network density and k-core structure, and we study how well these properties can be estimated as a function of the size of the subset of nodes utilized for the calibration. Finally, we also study how well the resilience to distress propagation in the network can be estimated using our method. We perform a first test on ensembles of synthetic networks generated with the Exponential Random Graph model, which allows to apply common tools from statistical mechanics. We then perform a second test on empirical networks taken from economic and financial contexts. In both cases, we find that a subset as small as 10 % of nodes can be enough to estimate the properties of the network along with its resilience with an error of 5 %.","2013-05-01","2024-02-04 22:59:24","2024-02-04 22:59:24","","","","","151","","Journal of Statistical Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\9HK5DRST\Musmeci et al. - 2013 - Bootstrapping Topological Properties and Systemic .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257604624_Bootstrapping_Topological_Properties_and_Systemic_Risk_of_Complex_Networks_Using_the_Fitness_Model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But interbank exposures imply the possibility of direct contagion: the insolvency of a single institution may trigger multiple bank failures due to direct credit exposures. The complete network of interbank exposures that gives rise to this channel of contagion is not observable, making it difficult to assess the systemic risk it poses. This paper uses data on loans and deposits between UK-resident banks to estimate the distribution of bilateral exposures. The potential for contagion is examined by assuming the sudden failure of each individual bank and estimating the losses incurred to other banks as a result of the initial shock. This study suggests that, while a single bank failure is rarely sufficient to trigger the outright failure of other banks, it does have the potential to weaken substantially the capital holdings of the banking system. And, when the failure of a single bank does result in knock-on effects, their severity depends greatly on the maintained assumptions about the distribution of interbank loans and the level of loss given default. But data constraints mean that drawing definitive conclusions is difficult.","2004-09-01","2024-02-04 23:50:32","2024-02-04 23:50:34","2024-02-04 23:50:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\MTGJIVCI\Wells - 2004 - Financial Interlinkages in the United Kingdom's In.pdf","","","Financial Interlinkages in the United Kingdom's Interbank Market and the Risk of Contagion; Simon J.

In particular, for stronger mutually supportive relationship between the ÿrms, collective phenomena such as bursts and avalanches of defaults can be observed in the model. In this context, traditional credit risk models are inadequate because they underestimate the required capital bu er.

We propose a model for the individual liabilities, which, following a Bayesian approach, we then condition on the observed total liabilities and assets and, potentially, on certain observed individual liabilities. We construct a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution. These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for the outcomes of interest. As one application we derive default probabilities of individual banks and discuss their sensitivity with respect to prior information included to model the network.

We find that of the 21 banks directly participating in NBO, only four are of systemic importance in the sense that their inability to send payments would have a significant effect on the other banks in the system. Moreover, the level of such systemic risk varies substantially, depending on the liquidity available to individual banks and on overall activity in the system. On most days, the systemic effects would be limited due to benign liquidity conditions in the system.

Most existing work has focused on modeling static networks, which represent either a single time snapshot or an aggregate view over time. There has been recent interest in statistical modeling of dynamic networks, which are observed at multiple points in time and offer a richer representation of many complex phenomena. In this paper, we present a state-space model for dynamic networks that extends the well-known stochastic blockmodel for static networks to the dynamic setting. We fit the model in a near-optimal manner using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) augmented with a local search. We demonstrate that the EKF-based algorithm performs competitively with a state-of-the-art algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling but is significantly less computationally demanding. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","2014","2024-02-10 21:56:00","2024-02-10 21:56:02","","552-562","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\X463K4LD\Xu and Hero III - 2014 - Dynamic stochastic blockmodels for time-evolving s.pdf","","","dynamic network; extended Kalman filter; on-line estimation; State-space social network model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a network stability property would be also useful for portfolio investment and risk management.","2009-07-15","2024-02-11 00:44:28","2024-02-11 00:44:28","2024-02-11 00:44:28","2956-2964","","14","388","","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\ZBS4RQVE\Huang et al. - 2009 - A network analysis of the Chinese stock market.pdf","","","Clique; Stock correlation network; Clustering coefficient; Independent set; Stock price fluctuations; Complex network theory; Component; Portfolio investment; Scale-free degree distribution; Topological stability; Topology structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, a winner-take-all approach is used to determine if two nodes are connected by an edge. So far, no previous work has attempted to construct a full network of US stock prices that gives full information about their interdependence. We report that all networks based on connecting stocks of highly correlated stock prices, price returns and trading volumes, display a scalefree degree distribution. The results from this work clearly suggest that the variation of stock prices are strongly influenced by a relatively small number of stocks.

It becomes challenging to apply machine learning to such large and sparse graphs. Graph representation learning seeks to embed the nodes of a graph into a euclidean vector space such that graph topological properties are preserved after the transformation. In this paper, we present a novel application of representation learning to bipartite graphs of credit card transactions in order to learn embeddings of account and merchant entities. Our framework is inspired by popular approaches in graph embeddings and is trained on two internal transaction datasets. This approach yields highly effective embeddings, as quantified by link prediction AUC and F1 score. Further, the resulting entity vectors retain intuitive semantic similarity that is explored through visualizations and other qualitative analyses.

Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work addresses these challenges in their solutions.

How will we explain from first principles the universal and ubiquitous coherence in the structure of these realistic but complex networks? In order to analyze these large sparse graphs, we use combinatorial, probabilistic, and spectral methods, as well as new and improved tools to analyze these networks. The examples of these networks have led us to focus on new, general, and powerful ways to look at graph theory.

At the heart of the system lies the stock exchange mechanism, which establishes a time-evolving network of trades among companies and individuals. Such network can be inferred through correlations between time series of companies stock prices, allowing the overall system to be characterized by techniques borrowed from network science. Here we study the presence of communities in the inferred stock market network, and show that the knowledge about the communities alone can provide a nearly complete representation of the system topology. This is done by defining a simple null model, a randomized version of the studied network sharing only the sizes and interconnectivity between communities observed. We show that many topological characteristics of the inferred networks are carried over the networks generated by the null model. In particular, we find that in periods of instability, such as during a financial crisis, the network strays away from a state of well-defined community structure to a much more uniform topological organization. We show that the framework presented here provides a good null model representation of topological variations taking place in the market during crises. Also, the general approach used in this work can be extended to other systems.","2015-07-27","2024-02-14 20:36:10","2024-02-14 20:36:13","2024-02-14 20:36:10","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1501.05040 [physics, q-fin]","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\R7I6KNTH\Silva et al. - 2015 - Modular Dynamics of Financial Market Networks.pdf; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\84ILL9KD\1501.html","","","Physics - Physics and Society; Quantitative Finance - Statistical Finance; 05C82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1501.05040","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, dynamically structured learning framework is required to catch up with the evolution of unstable class concepts, i.e., concept drifts. Second, imbalanced class distribution over data stream demands a mechanism to intensify the underrepresented class concepts for improved overall performance. To alleviate the challenges brought by these issues, we propose the recursive ensemble approach (REA) in this paper. To battle against the imbalanced learning problem in training data chunk received at any timestamp t, i.e., $${{\mathcal{S}}_t,}$$REA adaptively pushes into $${{\mathcal{S}}_t}$$part of minority class examples received within [0, t − 1] to balance its skewed class distribution. Hypotheses are then progressively developed over time for all balanced training data chunks and combined together as an ensemble classifier in a dynamically weighted manner, which therefore addresses the concept drifts issue in time. Theoretical analysis proves that REA can provide less erroneous prediction results than a comparative algorithm. Besides that, empirical study on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world data set is also applied to validate effectiveness of REA as compared with other algorithms in terms of evaluation metrics consisting of overall prediction accuracy and ROC curve.","2011-03-01","2024-02-14 20:43:04","2024-02-14 20:43:06","2024-02-14 20:43:04","35-50","","1","2","","Evolving Systems","Towards incremental learning of nonstationary imbalanced data stream","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\XXG975IJ\Chen and He - 2011 - Towards incremental learning of nonstationary imba.pdf","","","Concept drift; Ensemble learning; Imbalanced learning; Incremental learning; Nonstationary data; Stream data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we introduce the time-varying graphical lasso (TVGL), a method of inferring time-varying networks from raw time series data. We cast the problem in terms of estimating a sparse time-varying inverse covariance matrix, which reveals a dynamic network of interdependencies between the entities. Since dynamic network inference is a computationally expensive task, we derive a scalable message-passing algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in an efficient way. We also discuss several extensions, including a streaming algorithm to update the model and incorporate new observations in real time.

This theory is constructed upon the interpretation of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix as the Fourier transform for graph signals. We formulate the graph learning problem as a precision matrix estimation with generalized Laplacian constraints, and we propose a new optimization algorithm. Our formulation takes a covariance matrix as input and at each iteration updates one row/column of the precision matrix by solving a non-negative quadratic program. Experiments using synthetic data with generalized Laplacian precision matrix show that our method detects the nonzero entries and it estimates its values more precisely than the graphical Lasso. For texture images we obtain graphs whose edges follow the orientation.

While such problems are convex, existing methods cannot guarantee that solutions will have specific graph topology properties (e.g., being a tree), which are desirable for some applications. The problem of learning a graph with topology properties is in general non-convex. In this paper, we propose an approach to solve these problems by decomposing them into two sub-problems for which efficient solutions are known. Specifically, a graph topology inference (GTI) step is employed to select a feasible graph topology. Then, a graph weight estimation (GWE) step is performed by solving a generalized graph Laplacian estimation problem, where edges are constrained by the topology found in the GTI step. Our main result is a bound on the error of the GWE step as a function of the error in the GTI step. This error bound indicates that the GTI step should be solved using an algorithm that approximates the data similarity matrix by another matrix whose entries have been thresholded to zero to have the desired type of graph topology. The GTI stage can leverage existing methods, which are typically based on minimizing the total weight of removed edges. Since the GWE stage is an inverse covariance estimation problem with linear constraints, it can be solved using existing convex optimization methods. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve good results for both synthetic and texture image data.","2018-05","2024-02-17 13:54:31","2024-02-17 13:54:31","2024-02-17 13:54:31","2399-2413","","9","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\HHB7T3T4\8309394.html; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\DZ6L8FRC\Pavez et al. - 2018 - Learning Graphs With Monotone Topology Properties .pdf","","","Bipartite graph; Covariance matrices; Estimation; graph signal processing; Laplace equations; Signal processing algorithms; Approximation algorithms; attractive GMRF; bipartite graphs; connected graph; graph Laplacian; Graph learning; graphical models; structure learning; Topology; trees","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we study the influence of the time scale on their construction. Methodology/Principal Findings For our analysis we use correlation-based networks obtained from the daily closing prices of stock market data. More precisely, we use the stocks that currently comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and estimate financial networks where nodes correspond to stocks and edges correspond to none vanishing correlation coefficients. That means only if a correlation coefficient is statistically significant different from zero, we include an edge in the network. This construction procedure results in unweighted, undirected networks. By separating the time series of stock prices in non-overlapping intervals, we obtain one network per interval. The length of these intervals corresponds to the time scale of the data, whose influence on the construction of the networks will be studied in this paper. Conclusions/Significance Numerical analysis of four different measures in dependence on the time scale for the construction of networks allows us to gain insights about the intrinsic time scale of the stock market with respect to a meaningful graph-theoretical analysis.","2010-09-30","2024-02-17 15:33:35","2024-02-17 15:33:36","2024-02-17 15:33:35","e12884","","9","5","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\SNMXVXMG\Emmert-Streib and Dehmer - 2010 - Influence of the Time Scale on the Construction of.pdf","","","Network analysis; Finance; Financial markets; Stock markets; Topology; Reflection; Structure of markets; Time series analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main purpose of BankSim is the generation of synthetic data that can be used for fraud detection research. Statistical and a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of relations between merchants and customers were used to develop and calibrate the model. Our ultimate goal is for BankSim to be usable to model relevant scenarios that combine normal payments and injected known fraud signatures. The data sets generated by BankSim contain no personal information or disclosure of legal and private customer transactions. Therefore, it can be shared by academia, and others, to develop and reason about fraud detection methods. Synthetic data has the added benefit of being easier to acquire, faster and at less cost, for experimentation even for those that have access to their own data. We argue that BankSim generates data that usefully approximates the relevant aspects of the real data.

This paper summarises the findings of such simulations, provides a critical assessment of the modelling assumptions on which they are based, and discusses their use in financial stability analysis. On the whole, such simulations suggest that contagious defaults are unlikely but cannot be fully ruled out, at least in some countries. If contagion does take place, then it could lead to the breakdown of a substantial fraction of the banking system, thus imposing high costs to society. However, when interpreting these results, one has to bear in mind the potential bias caused by the very strong assumptions underlying the simulations. Robustness tests indicate that the models might be able to correctly predict whether or not contagion could be an issue and, possibly, also identify banks whose failure could give rise to contagion. They are, however, less suited for stress testing or for the analysis of policy options in crises, primarily due to their lack of behavioural foundations.","2011-08-01","2024-02-24 18:07:24","2024-02-24 18:07:24","2024-02-24 18:07:24","111-125","","3","7","","Journal of Financial Stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\QBKDGTG6\S1572308910000550.html; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\XRJA5WHI\Upper - 2011 - Simulation methods to assess the danger of contagi.pdf","","","Systemic risk; Contagion; Domino effects; Interbank lending","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the generation of them is still problematic. Existing approaches are either computationally demanding and beyond analytic control or analytically accessible but highly approximate. Here, we propose a solution to this long-standing problem by introducing a fast method that allows one to obtain expectation values and standard deviations of any topological property analytically, for any binary, weighted, directed or undirected network. Remarkably, the time required to obtain the expectation value of any property analytically across the entire graph ensemble is as short as that required to compute the same property using the adjacency matrix of the single original network. Our method reveals that the null behavior of various correlation properties is different from what was believed previously, and is highly sensitive to the particular network considered. Moreover, our approach shows that important structural properties (such as the modularity used in community detection problems) are currently based on incorrect expressions, and provides the exact quantities that should replace them.","2011-08","2024-02-24 18:19:28","2024-02-24 18:19:30","2024-02-24 18:19:28","083001","","8","13","","New J.

Using graph theory and a recently developed time series technique, we are able to identify the most important sector in the market and the patterns of risk spillovers across sectors over time. Unlike the standard econometric modelling, the graph theory enables us to approach this question in a more reader-friendly way. Empirical results show that the industrial sector plays the most important role and should thus be considered a systemically important sector in the stock market of China. The spillover structure is found to be time-varying. While the industrial sector dominates the system for most of the time, other sectors, such as the consumer discretionary sector, also appear occasionally as the central sector. Our empirical results also indicate that the simple correlation based approach can produce equally useful information as the more advanced econometric models can.","2018-09-13","2024-02-26 14:33:47","2024-02-26 14:33:49","2024-02-26 14:33:47","","","","","","","Systemic Risks and Spillovers in the Stock Market of China","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\KJSSZRSG\Wu et al. - 2018 - Systemic Risks and Spillovers in the Stock Market .pdf","","","Systemic risk; Contagion; Stock market; Graph theory; Spillover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3248975","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the initial success, most, if not all, of the existing works are designed for static networks. Nonetheless, many realistic networks are intrinsically dynamic and presented as a collection of system logs (i.e., timestamped interactions/edges between entities), which pose a new research direction for us: how can we synthesize realistic dynamic networks by directly learning from the system logs? In addition, how can we ensure the generated graphs preserve both the structural and temporal characteristics of the real data? To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end deep generative framework named TagGen. In particular, we start with a novel sampling strategy for jointly extracting structural and temporal context information from temporal networks. On top of that, TagGen parameterizes a bi-level self-attention mechanism together with a family of local operations to generate temporal random walks. At last, a discriminator gradually selects generated temporal random walks, that are plausible in the input data, and feeds them to an assembling module for generating temporal networks. The experimental results in seven real-world data sets across a variety of metrics demonstrate that (1) TagGen outperforms all baselines in the temporal interaction network generation problem, and (2) TagGen significantly boosts the performance of the prediction models in the tasks of anomaly detection and link prediction.","2020-08-20","2024-03-05 19:24:18","2024-03-05 19:24:19","2024-03-05","401–411","","","","","","","KDD '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\YCJDCJF6\Zhou et al. - 2020 - A Data-Driven Graph Generative Model for Temporal .pdf","","","graph generative model; temporal networks; transformer model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many real-world problems involve temporal graphs whose topology and attribute values evolve dynamically over time, including important applications such as protein folding, human mobility networks, and social network growth. As yet, deep generative models for temporal graphs are not yet well understood and existing techniques for static graphs are not adequate for temporal graphs since they cannot 1) encode and decode continuously-varying graph topology chronologically, 2) enforce validity via temporal constraints, or 3) ensure efficiency for information-lossless temporal resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a new model, called ``Temporal Graph Generative Adversarial Network'' (TG-GAN) for continuous-time temporal graph generation, by modeling the deep generative process for truncated temporal random walks and their compositions. Specifically, we first propose a novel temporal graph generator that jointly model truncated edge sequences, time budgets, and node attributes, with novel activation functions that enforce temporal validity constraints under recurrent architecture. In addition, a new temporal graph discriminator is proposed, which combines time and node encoding operations over a recurrent architecture to distinguish the generated sequences from the real ones sampled by a newly-developed truncated temporal random walk sampler. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate TG-GAN significantly outperforms the comparison methods in efficiency and effectiveness.","2021-04-19","2024-03-05 19:25:32","2024-03-05 19:25:32","2024-03-05 19:25:32","2104-2116","","","","","","TG-GAN","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2005.08323 [cs, stat]","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\ZQ3ZV7J7\Zhang et al. - 2021 - TG-GAN Continuous-time Temporal Graph Generation .pdf; C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\462C8NMH\2005.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper specifically focuses on the speed of reversion of transaction costs and available depth to their equilibrium levels in this market for overnight unsecured funds from 4 September 2000 to 31 December 2007. The reported evidence points to time-varying liquidity adjustments and identifies liquidity, market activity and the institutional setting of the ECB’s refinancing operations as significant determinants of the observed resiliency regimes. Our analysis also shows how the speed of mean reversion of market liquidity, by affecting the level and the volatility of the overnight market rate, also affects the anchoring of the yield curve in the euro area.","2012-11-27","2024-03-05 19:47:25","2024-03-05 19:47:25","2024-03-05 19:47:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\maroa\Zotero\storage\AMKINQHN\Beaupain and Durré - 2012 - Nonlinear Liquidity Adjustments in the Euro Area O.pdf","","","price impact; financial turmoil; market microstructure; mean reversion; overnight money market; transaction costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2181364","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The properties of the proposed measure of pairwise similarity in comparison with the classic Pearson correlation are studied. The simple measure of pairwise similarity is applied (in parallel with the classic correlation) for the study of Russian and Swedish market graphs.

The chapter considers two similarity measures: classic Pearson correlation and sign correlation. We study the associated market graphs and compare the conditional risk of the market graph construction for these two measures of similarity. Our main finding is that the conditional risk for the sign correlation is much better than for the Pearson correlation for larger values of threshold for several probabilistic models. In addition, we show that for some model the conditional risk for sign correlation dominates over the conditional risk for Pearson correlation for all values of threshold. These properties make sign correlation a more appropriate measure for the maximum clique analysis.","2013","2024-05-02 12:57:27","2024-05-02 12:57:27","","29-41","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","New York, NY","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","Goldengorin, Boris I.; Kalyagin, Valery A.; Pardalos, Panos M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
